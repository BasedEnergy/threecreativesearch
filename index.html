                    <p class="popup-text">
                        Jesse grew up on the central coast of California, where he got started working for large staffing companies in Santa Barbara.
                        He also worked in Portland as the sole recruiter for one of the most exciting independent ad agencies in the country.
                        He most recently worked as an executive/direct hire recruiter for one best staffing agencies in creative recruiting.
                        Over the last 16 years, he’s worked on C-level searches - successfully - for large companies, entry level designers for small ad agencies and everything in between.
                        In the last year he’s closed positions all over the US, in all time zones.
                        He chose to start Three Creative Search because he wanted to do something different and change the way candidates and clients look at recruiters.
                        He’s not in this for the big money ( though money puts food on the table )  and that has allowed him to put the people before the paycheck.

                    <p class="popup-text">
                        Katie grew up in San Diego and shortly after graduating high school moved to Los Angeles, where she got her start working in the entertainment industry, acting in independent films, working as an extra on blockbuster films and attending college. Over the last 20 years, she has done it all, or at least everything she ever put her mind to. She graduated beauty school and became a successful stylist and barber, working for some of the best salons and barbershops on the west coast. With her love for entertaining and her ability to write she made the decision to become a stand up comic in Portland, Oregon, successfully running shows (most notably with Hutch Harris from the Thermals) and performing alongside some of the funniest comedians currently in the business - if you want names, you’ll have to ask her. After hanging up the mic and stepping down from the loneliest place on earth - the stage - she went back to school at Portland State as a Film major, marrying her experience as an actor, stand up comedian and stylist, eventually relocating to Atlanta, GA to work in the film industry on the Production side. Aside from running the operations at Three Creative Search, she currently moonlights as the front of house manager/props stage assistant  at Dad’s Garage and is taking classes so she can find her way back to the stage...
